# Peace-Resources
While attending a Peace innovation conference the attendees quickly realized that we did not know what each other was doing, or even heard of some of our organizations, despite being a small, selected group. Peace Accelerators took the initiative to compile a list of resources so anyone interested in Peace technology can stay up to date, find partners, and tools to make Peace more accessible. This is a completely open-sourced repository collectively maintained by the entire Peace community, contribute [here](https://github.com/kibagateaux/Peace-Resources/blob/master/Contributing.md)
